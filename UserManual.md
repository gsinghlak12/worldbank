This is the searach page, seen after successfully logging in or clicking the search button in the navigation bar

![Search Page](https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/11-SearchPage.png)

The search bar has multiple useful features, it can get the indicators for one country, or 2 countries and compare them throughout the years.
(the years are yet to be implemented)<br/>
You need to fill ALL input fields that are available so that the search knows what it's looking for, otherwise a graph will not be shown
<br/><br/>
You can choose to select 2 countries by clicking the '+' button near the country input field, 
this can be closed again by clicking the '-' button when the second country field appears

<img src="https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/12-Search2.png" alternative='Search 2 countries'>

The input boxes for the countries and indicators are special, they can be used just like a normal drop down box...

<img src="https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/13-CountryDropdown.png" alternative='Drop down box' height="500">

Or you can input your own text into them, and they shall filter out all of the available options that you can choose from<br/>
NOTE: You have to click on the drop down box value or type it with the correct capitalisation for the results to appear as our search feature is case sensitive

<img src="https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/14-FilteredDropDown.png" alternative='Filtered Drop down box' height="500">

When filling in the search form with the correct information, a graph will appear that will display the country's data on that indicator point

<img src="https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/15-Chart1.png" alternative='Chart for single country' height="500">

This feature is further extended when gender is taken into account, if the indicator is gender oriented then the search will try to look for its male counterpart, being successful in this it will plot 2 of the genders onto the chart and you will be able to compare the data, the key will tell you which line represents which gender

<img src="https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/15.5-ChartWithFeMa.png" alternative='FeMa Chart' height="500">

When searching for 2 countries it will set the key to be the specific country and you will be able to see both the data points on the graph

<img src="https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/16-Chart2.png" alternative='Chart for 2 countries' height="500">

When you are logged in, you might notice that some of the navigation bar buttons have been changed, 
you no longer have the ability to register an account or log in, as you are already in an account! <br/>
Instead the Buttons have now been changed to History, and Log out.

<img src="https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/17-ChangedButtons.png" alternative='History logout buttons'>

This is the history page that is found when you click on the history button when you are logged in

![History Page](https://github.com/gsinghlak12/worldbank/blob/main/User_Manual_images/18-HistoryPage.png)

Here it will show you all of your previous searches that have been successful and have produced a graph, including the date that you made the search and the countires and indicators you used.<br/>
If you want to log out, just click on the log out button and you will be logged out of your account <br/><br/>
