# Word-for-women - World Bank Data Visualisation

The World For Women.

The brief was to create a prototype data visualisation dashboard for The World Bank that displays its data on World Development Indicators. 
We decided on three "must-have" features to include:
 - Log In Feature
 - Search Functionality
 - History Functionality
In addition to these core features, we were given a number of other User Stories to fulfil and the goal was to create the best possible application within one week.

## Objective

Since there were over 1,300 indicators available in the database from The World Bank, the focus of our project was data that pertains to the lives of women around the world. Where we had data for both men and women for certain indicators, we have chosen to display both as a point of reference. 

Being able to select different countries to see what the regional differences are as well as using graphs to graphically show these. 

Our Database is based on the World Development Indicators data from The World Bank, which contain over a thousand annual indicators of
economic development from hundreds of countries around the world. We will be using a subset of these for the purpose of this website.
The database source can be found [here!](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/world-development-indicators)
