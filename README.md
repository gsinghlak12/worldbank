## Objective

Our focus of this project is to show what life is like for women across the world by visualising data from The World Bank. Where we have had data for both men and women for certain indicators, we have chosen to display both as a point of reference. 

Being able to select different countries to see what the regional differences are as well as using graphs to graphically show these. 
We want to at least include 3 core features:
 - Log In Feature
 - Search Functionality
 - History Functionality
